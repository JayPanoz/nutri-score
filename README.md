## What is Nutri-score
> Nutri-Score, an indicator of nutritional quality

With a release date of November 2017, the __Nutri-Score__ is by definition a new labeling system that indicates the nutritional values ​​of a product in a more simplified way. So, what is it exactly? Attached to the front of packaging, it complements the mandatory nutrition declaration required by the European Commission regulations in force.

Its goal is to help consumers turn to wholesome, healthy and healthy foods, and to know exactly what to choose to fight junk food.

The __Nutri-Score__ comes in the form of a logo with a 5-level scale, from the most favorable product to the least favorable nutritionally. niwali keto The device thus consists of 5 colors ranging from dark green to dark orange, and 5 letters ranging from A to E. Each color is associated with a letter.

_Class A_ products are therefore considered to be the healthiest. On the other hand, when the label has a qualification approaching the letter E, it means that the food is considered too fat, too sweet or too salty.
